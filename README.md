We're just trying out stuff here, so this might most likely be of no interest for you.

## Still curious?

But if you are very curious: At [dajool](http://dajool.com) we've got thumbnail service based on Django. This service creates thumbs from (big) images located anywhere in the web and caches them locally. This even works for PDF files, where it creates and caches thumbs from the first page. It is used in scenarios with bandwith limitations, aso. Django and Python are very cool, but we want to check out other languages and frameworks.
